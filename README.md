# HibernateInheritanceMapping
Hibernate Inheritance Mapping is a technique in Java Hibernate ORM that maps object-oriented inheritance relationships to relational database tables, allowing different classes to share a common table or have separate tables based on their inheritance structure. It ensures data persistence while maintaining object-oriented principles.
